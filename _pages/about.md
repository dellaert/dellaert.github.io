I am Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Research Scientist at Google AI. 

I joined Georgia Tech in 2001 after obtaining a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science, where I worked with Hans Moravec, Chuck Thorpe, Sebastian Thrun, and Steve Seitz. Before that, I also obtained degrees from Case Western Reserve University and The Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium.

While on leave from Georgia Tech in 2016-2018, I served as Technical Project Lead at Facebook's Building 8 hardware division. Before that I was also Chief Scientist at [Skydio](skydio.com), a startup founded by MIT grads to create intuitive interfaces for micro-aerial vehicles. 

My research is in the overlap between robotics and computer vision, and I am particularly interested in graphical model techniques to solve large-scale problems in mapping, 3D reconstruction, and increasingly model-predictive control. The GTSAM toolbox embodies many of the ideas his research group has worked on in the past few years and is available at https://gtsam.org.
