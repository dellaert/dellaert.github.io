I am a Professor in the [School of Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/), at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

From 2022-2024 I was CTO at [Verdant Robotics](https://www.verdantrobotics.com/), a Bay Area startup that is creating the most advanced multi-action robotic farming implement, designed for superhuman farming! In 2025 I switched to a part-time role as Chief AI office after returning to Georgia Tech.

I joined Georgia Tech in 2001 after obtaining a Ph.D. from [Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/), where I worked with [Hans Moravec](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/), [Chuck Thorpe](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), [Sebastian Thrun](http://robots.stanford.edu/), and [Steve Seitz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~seitz/). Before that, I also obtained degrees from Case Western Reserve University and The Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium.

In 2015-2016 I served as Chief Scientist at [Skydio](skydio.com), a startup founded by MIT grads to create intuitive interfaces for micro-aerial vehicles. In 2016-2018, I served as Technical Project Lead at Facebook's "Building 8" hardware division within [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/). Finally, I was a part-time Research Scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) from 2020-2022, before I joined Verdant Robotics. 

My research is in the overlap between robotics and computer vision, and I am particularly interested in graphical model techniques to solve large-scale problems in mapping, 3D reconstruction, and increasingly model-predictive control. The GTSAM toolbox embodies many of the ideas his research group has worked on in the past few years and is available at [gtsam.org](https://gtsam.org) and [the GTSAM Github repo](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/pulse/monthly).

Note: this site is still a bit sparse as I am moving from [my former iWeb-generated website](http://www.dellaert.com/) to Github Pages.
