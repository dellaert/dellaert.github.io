I am Professor in the [School of Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a Research Scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/). 

I joined Georgia Tech in 2001 after obtaining a Ph.D. from [Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/), where I worked with [Hans Moravec](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/), [Chuck Thorpe](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), [Sebastian Thrun](http://robots.stanford.edu/), and [Steve Seitz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~seitz/). Before that, I also obtained degrees from Case Western Reserve University and The Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium.

While on leave from Georgia Tech in 2016-2018, I served as Technical Project Lead at Facebook's "Building 8" hardware division within [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/). Before that I was also Chief Scientist at [Skydio](skydio.com), a startup founded by MIT grads to create intuitive interfaces for micro-aerial vehicles. 

My research is in the overlap between robotics and computer vision, and I am particularly interested in graphical model techniques to solve large-scale problems in mapping, 3D reconstruction, and increasingly model-predictive control. The GTSAM toolbox embodies many of the ideas his research group has worked on in the past few years and is available at [gtsam.org](https://gtsam.org) and [the GTSAM Github repo](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/pulse/monthly).

Note: this site is still a bit sparse as I am moving from [my former iWeb-generated website](http://www.dellaert.com/) to Github Pages.
