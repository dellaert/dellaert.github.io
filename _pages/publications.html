  <p>I try to keep this page up to date but most likely my <a
      href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZxXBaswAAAAJ>Google Scholar page</a> is more recent, and
    you can also see there which papers are the most read (or at least cited!).</p>

  <p>
    This page uses JavaScript and dynamic
    HTML to render my publications. If this page does not render
    correctly (which can happen if you have an old browser, you
    have disabled JavaScript, or there is a bug in my code) please
    let me know.

  <p>
    You can also browse the <a href="/assets/bib/Dellaert.bib">bibtex
      file with more detailed references</a> from which this page
    was generated. Also, feel free to
    copy <a href="/assets/js/bibtex.js">the JavaScript source for this
      page</a> (please leave in copyright notices) but know it
    is under perpetual development and is used at your own
    risk. If you do, you will also need
    the <a href="/assets/css/bibtex.css">CSS style file</a>.
