RSS 2020 introduced <strong>Test of Time Award</strong>, given to highest
impact papers published at RSS (and potentially journal versions
thereof) from at least ten years ago. Impact may mean that it changed
how we think about problems or about robotic design, that it brought
fully new problems to the attention of the community, or that it
pioneered new approach to robotic design or problem solving.

On July 14, 2020, Michael Kaess and I were honored to give the <strong>RSS 2020 Test of Time Keynote </strong>, titled "From Square Root SAM to GTSAM: Factor Graphs in Robotics."
